    This program is a minesweeper game with a solver added to it.
    The game can be played without the solver.

    To run the game, open the file in your browser and start playing.
    Tested only on Chrome and Mozilla. 

    Solve button: will attempt to solve the game. 
        It will either solve, lose, or get stuck

    #Mines button: will let you change the number of mines. (1 <= n <= 100 ).
        It will start a new game after change.

    New game button: will end current game, randomize the board for a new game. 

    I tested 40 games with 30 mines and 40 games with 40 mines. These are the results. 

    30 mines (40 games)     40 mines (40 games)
        W – 12.5 %               W – 60 %
        L - 40   %               L - 15 %
        S - 47.5 %               S - 25 %
